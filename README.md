### Agent Memory System
**Repo:** https://github.com/clawddar/agent-memory-system  
**Stack:** Postgres + ChromaDB + Python (optional LangChain/LangGraph)  
**What:** Hybrid architecture for persistent agent memory that learns from experience.

**Why it's awesome:**
- Semantic search over task history (ChromaDB embeddings)
- Structured performance tracking (Postgres metrics)
- Smart agent routing based on historical success rates
- Context injection with past solutions
- Compound learning (gets smarter with each execution)
- Optional LangChain/LangGraph integration (not required)

**Features:**
- Docker Compose stack (Postgres 16 + ChromaDB)
- Python API for task storage and similarity search
- Auto-updating agent performance stats (triggers)
- LangChain adapter for those in the LangChain ecosystem
- Complete workflow examples and documentation

**Use case:** Task automation systems where agents should learn from past executions and route intelligently.
